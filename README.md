# machinelearning-thu
This repository contains experiments, implementations and written reports as part of the "Machine Learning" lecture at Tsinghua University.

## Midterm Summary
The mid term report summarizes the first half of the lecture's content and illustrates each field's key aspects and their relations.

## Experiments and Implementations
For each larger topic, we implemented the method by ourselves and conducted experiments on toy data. Each folder includes the implementation code, raw experiment results, and a written report.
